# 30 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms
Keeping track of learning ds&a.  

**Day 1 (Aug 12, 2021):**  

Working on Queues. Pretty basic add method and remove method. Spent a few minutes setting up a node project with nodemon.

**Day 2 (Aug 13, 2021):**

Made a Stack class. It's very similar to an array but you build more controls by implementing functions you want to use. I created  pop(), push(), and peek(), and length() methods. 

The algorithm assigned in the course annoyed me. I do not want to create a class that take a Stack and force Queue functionality. It's literally just stacking one Stack, restack into a second Stack, then return the last item in the first Stack as a Queue item. I get the idea, I refuse to waste time implementing busy work. 

I did add a print() to both Stack and Queue classes.

**Day 3 (Aug 14, 2021)**

First thing: this is a new computer and I forgot to set up SSH with Github. Of course, it's been a long time since I did this on my previous computer and that meant some reading in the Github docs. A bit of copy and paste in the terminal and voila! I can upload to Github!

Back to our DS&A show...
